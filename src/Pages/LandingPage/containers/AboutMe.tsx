While I no longer compete, I continue to train regularly, including swimming, running, and going to the gym. For me, sports are essential‚Äînot only for staying physically fit but also for maintaining mental balance. They help me relax, recharge, and work more efficiently. One of my dreams is to complete an Ironman in the coming years.",

I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the stories of both successful and less successful founders, learning from their journeys. I genuinely enjoy building products, and the idea that people can derive real utility from something I‚Äôve created is deeply fulfilling. I also believe that working on exciting projects is the best way to acquire new skills, pushing me to keep innovating and learning.",

Over time, I‚Äôve embraced the challenge and discovered how much I enjoy crafting engaging content. Content creation not only allows me to express the creative side of my personality but also plays a crucial role in B2C engagement. I‚Äôm confident that my skills in this area will continue to grow as I keep exploring and learning.",

              I‚Äôm Emmanuel, a French student originally from the island of Guadeloupe, where I grew up until the age of 18 before moving to Paris to pursue my studies at Sciences Po. Now in my third year, majoring in Economics, I‚Äôve developed solid skills in technology and web development, driven by a passion for entrepreneurship and innovation. I believe in the importance of continuous learning and skill development, especially in a world where knowledge is more accessible than ever.
